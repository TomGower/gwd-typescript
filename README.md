# gwd-typescript

A re-factor of my scoresheet for playing Geeks Who Drink-style pub quiz as a tool to learn TypeScript.

The original is deployed at <https://nameless-stream-40581.herokuapp.com/>

Code for the original is available at <https://github.com/TomGower/gwd-scoresheet>

To run locally, 1. npm install, 2. npm run build-dev, 3. npm run start-dev. The site runs on localhost:2017

This repository has been updated to GWD's current 7-round format as of March 2, 2021. All known TS-related issues were resolved with that update.
